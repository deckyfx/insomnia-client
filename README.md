## ðŸš€ Usage

### As Code

Import and use the Insomnia client programmatically in your TypeScript/JavaScript projects:

```typescript
import { InsomniaClient } from "insomnia-cli";

const client = new InsomniaClient();
// Load insomnia yaml
await client.loadConfig("path/to/insomnia-export.yaml");
// Figure out the requests can be made
await client.getRequestNodePaths();

// Execute a specific request
const response = await client.request("parsed request path or request ID");
```

### As Executable

Run requests directly from the command line:

```bash
# Execute a single request
bun run src/index.ts --config insomnia-export.yaml "parsed request path or request ID"
```

### As Interactive

Launch interactive mode to browse and execute requests:

```bash
# Start interactive mode
bun run src/index.ts --interactive
```

In interactive mode you can:

- Browse available requests and folders
